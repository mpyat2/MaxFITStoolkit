This collection of Windows command-line utilities is designed for manipulating FITS files, primarily to streamline photometry data reduction with IRIS, a free astronomical image processing software. Currently, the package assists in building calibration master frames and preparing calibrated science images for photometry in AstroImageJ.
The Toolkit is formerly known as "FITS Command-line Utilities" (http://fits-command-line-utilities.sourceforge.net)
